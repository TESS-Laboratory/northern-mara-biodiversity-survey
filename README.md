# northern-mara-biodiversity-survey
This repository contains a summary report on "Report on Avian and Plant Species Biodiversity Baseline Survey Conducted in the Northern Mara between 6th to 21st November 2024" and underlying data and workflows. 

This was created by Milcah Kirinyet (cheromilca@gmail.com), Dr Andrew Cunliffe (A.Cunliffe@exeter.ac.uk) and Dr Peter Tyrell (peterdavidtyrrell@gmail.com), as part of Milcah's Oppenheimer Impact Scholar project within the *Oppenheimer Programme in African Landscape Systems (OPALS)* (https://opals-exeter.org/) in partnership with Dascot Ltd., Sustain East Africa, and Enonkishu Conservancy.

The repo is structured as follows:
- **data**: Folder containing avian and vegetation data collected during the survey, and geolocation information for the sampling points.
The vegetation data has undergone data quality control, including taxonomic harmonisation and filtering out of ecologically sensitive data from specific transects but is retained in the overall species checklist.

The "avian_data_NM_2024.xlsl" contains:

- The Point_Count documents the raw data collected during point counts
- The Wetland_Counts documents the birds recorded in wetlands surveyed
- The Opportunistic_Sightings are records taken at any time besides the structured point counts
- The Threatened species are a list of birds from the survey that are listed under the IUCN redlist
- The Migratory species contains a list of migrant birds
- The forest-dependent birds contains a list of birds that are forest-dependent
- The Water birds contains a list of birds that are wetland-dependent
- The Avian checklist lists the 187 bird species identified during the survey
- The KenyanBirdChecklist lists the birds found in Kenya and their IUCN status and authority.


The "plant_data_NM_2024.xlsx" contains:

- The Species composition revised the raw data collected during the survey
- The Checklist is a list of all 412 floral species identified
- The Mbokishi contains floral species found in Mbokishi 
- The Enonkishu contains floral species found in Enonkishu
- The Olchoro contains floral species found in Olchoro 
- The Final checklist is a summary of species where found and their IUCN, CITES status

The "floral_harmonized_species_list.csv" contains the harmonised list of species for the raw data.

The "avian_transect point locations.xlsx" contains the georeferenced for the avian start and end points.

The " floral_transect_point_locations.csv" contains the georeferenced for the floral transect locations.

- **images**: Folder with images taken during the field exercise.
- **taxa_harmonisation**: Script detailing the taxonomic harmonisation process
- **data Sheets** : Folder containing the data Sheets for both avian and floral survey used during the study.
