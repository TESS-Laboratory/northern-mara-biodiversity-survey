# northern-mara-biodiversity-survey
Created as part of Milcah Kirinyet's (cheromilca@gmail.com) Oppenheimer Impact Scholar project, working with Dascot ltd., Sustain East Africa, and Enonkishu Conservancy.

This repository contains data, R scripts, and summary analyses from the biodiversity baseline survey undetaken in November 2024.

The primary output and analyses are documented in this report **Northern-Mara-Biodiversity Report.pdf**, authored in collaboration with Dr. Andrew Cunliffe (A.Cunliffe@exeter.ac.uk) and Dr. Peter Tyrell (peterdavidtyrrell@gmail.com).

- **data**: Folder containing avian and vegetation data collected during the survey, and geolocation information for the sampling points.
The vegetation data has undergone data quality control, including taxonomic harmonisation and filtering out of ecologically sensitive data from specific transects but is retained in the overall species checklist.

The "avian_data_NM_2024.xlsl" contains:

- The Point_Count documents the raw data collected during points counts
- The Wetland_Counts documents the birds recorded in wetlands surveyed
- The Opportunistic_Sightings are records taken at any time besides the structured point counts
- The Threatened species are list of birds from the survey that are listed under the IUCN redlist
- The Migratory species contains list of migrant birds
- The forest dependent birds contains list of birds that are forest dependent
- The Water birds contains list of birds that are wetland dependent
- The Avian checklist contains the list list of the 187 birds identified during the survey
- The KenyanBirdChecklist contains the list of birds found in Kenya and their IUCN status and authority.


The "plant_data_NM_2024.xlsx" contains:

- The Species composition revised the raw data collected during the survey
- The Checklist is a list of all 412 floral species identified
- The Mbokishi contains floral species found in Mbokishi 
- The Enonkishu contains floral species found in Enonkishu
- The Olchoro contains floral species found in Olchoro 
- The Final checklist is a summary of species where found and their IUCN ,CITES status

The "floral_harmonized_species_list.csv" contains the harmonised list of species for the raw data.

The "avian_transect point locations.xlsx" contains the georeferenced for the avian start and end points.

The " floral_transect_point_locations.csv" contains the georeferenced for the floral transect locations.

- **images**: Folder with images taken during the field exercise.
- **taxa_harmonisation**: Script detailing the taxonomic harmonisation process
- **data Sheets** : Folder containing the data Sheets for both avian and floral survey used during the study.
